In this preliminary work, we present an approach for augmentation of clustering  with Natural Language Explanations.
  In clustering there are 2 main challenges: a) choice of a proper, reasonable number of clusters and b) cluster analysis and profiling.
  There is a plethora of technics for a) but not so much for b), which is in the general a laborious task of explaining obtained clusters.
  %Clustering is in a sense art in that regard that it is an intuitive and iterative process. % This sentence is strange...
  %Therefore, XAI techniques are well suited in this area.
  In this work we propose a method that aids experts in cluster analysis by providing iterative, human-in-the-loop methodology of generating cluster explanations.
  In a convincing example, we show how the process of clustering on a set of "objective" variables could be facilitated with textual metadata.
  In our case images of products from online fashion store are used for clustering.
  Then product descriptions are used for profiling clusters.
