abstract = {Abstract Background In pain research and clinics, it is common practice to subgroup subjects according to shared pain characteristics. This is often achieved by computer-aided clustering. In response to a recent EU recommendation that computer-aided decision making should be transparent, we propose an approach that uses machine learning to provide (1) an understandable interpretation of a cluster structure to (2) enable a transparent decision process about why a person concerned is placed in a particular cluster. Methods Comprehensibility was achieved by transforming the interpretation problem into a classification problem: A sub-symbolic algorithm was used to estimate the importance of each pain measure for cluster assignment, followed by an item categorization technique to select the relevant variables. Subsequently, a symbolic algorithm as explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) provided understandable rules of cluster assignment. The approach was tested using 100-fold cross-validation. Results The importance of the variables of the data set (6 pain-related characteristics of 82 healthy subjects) changed with the clustering scenarios. The highest median accuracy was achieved by sub-symbolic classifiers. A generalized post-hoc interpretation of clustering strategies of the model led to a loss of median accuracy. XAI models were able to interpret the cluster structure almost as correctly, but with a slight loss of accuracy. Conclusions Assessing the variables importance in clustering is important for understanding any cluster structure. XAI models are able to provide a human-understandable interpretation of the cluster structure. Model selection must be adapted individually to the clustering problem. The advantage of comprehensibility comes at an expense of accuracy.},

  abstract = 	 {The price of explainability for a clustering task can be defined as the unavoidable loss, in terms of the objective function, if we force the final partition to be explainable. Here, we study this price for the following clustering problems: $k$-means, $k$-medians, $k$-centers and maximum-spacing. We provide upper and lower bounds for a natural model where explainability is achieved via decision trees. For the $k$-means and $k$-medians problems our upper bounds improve those obtained by [Dasgupta et. al, ICML 20] for low dimensions. Another contribution is a simple and efficient algorithm for building explainable clusterings for the $k$-means problem. We provide empirical evidence that its performance is better than the current state of the art for decision-tree based explainable clustering.}

To show clustering results to the analyst, cluster membership is typically represented by color coding. Our tools support the color consistency between different steps of the process. We shall demonstrate two-way clustering of spatial time series, in which clustering will be applied to places and to time steps.",

    abstract = { The ability to group items and events into functional categories is a fundamental characteristic of sophisticated thought. It is subserved by plasticity in many neural systems, including neocortical regions (sensory, prefrontal, parietal, and motor cortex), the medial temporal lobe, the basal ganglia, and midbrain dopaminergic systems. These systems interact during category learning. Corticostriatal loops may mediate recursive, bootstrapping interactions between fast reward-gated plasticity in the basal ganglia and slow reward-shaded plasticity in the cortex. This can provide a balance between acquisition of details of experiences and generalization across them. Interactions between the corticostriatal loops can integrate perceptual, response, and feedback-related aspects of the task and mediate the shift from novice to skilled performance. The basal ganglia and medial temporal lobe interact competitively or cooperatively, depending on the demands of the learning task. }
