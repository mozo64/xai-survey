\begin{abstract}
  In this preliminary work we present an approach for clustering augmented with Natural Language Explanations.
  With clustering there are 2 main challenges: a) choice of proper, reasonable number of clusters and b) cluster profiling.
  There is a plethora of technics for a) but not so much for b), which is in general laborious task of explaining obtained clusters.
  Clustering is in a sense art in that regard that it is intuitive and iterative process.
  Therefore, XAI techniques are well suited in this area.
  On a convincing example we show how process of clustering on a set of "objective" variables could be facilitated with textual metadata.
  In our case images of products from online fashion store are used for clustering.
  Then product descriptions are used for profiling clusters.
